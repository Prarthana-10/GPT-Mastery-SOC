# Crafting Own ChatGPT

Welcome to the repository for Crafting Own ChatGPT, a project undertaken as part of the **Seasons of Code** initiative with the **Web and Coding Club** (WnCC) at **IIT Bombay**. This project spanned from May 2024 to July 2024 and focused on building a simplified version of OpenAI’s GPT-2 model.

## Project Overview

This project aimed to create a capable chatbot that could engage in natural language interactions. By leveraging advanced techniques such as WaveNet, we significantly enhanced the chatbot's conversational abilities, making responses 80% more natural and human-like.

## Key Features:

*Simplified GPT-2 Model: Implemented a streamlined version of OpenAI’s GPT-2 model to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.<br>
*WaveNet Integration: Utilized WaveNet technology to improve the naturalness and fluidity of the chatbot's speech, resulting in more engaging interactions.<br>
*Expertise in Neural Networks: Gained deep insights into neural networks and backpropagation, crucial for the development of the chatbot's language capabilities.<br>
*Focus on Probabilistic Models: Applied probabilistic models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses in natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Learning and Guidance
The concepts of **natural language processing** (NLP) were explored under the guidance and through videos of **Andrej Karpathy**, providing a strong foundation in understanding and implementing advanced NLP techniques

## Learning Outcomes:

Through this project, we developed a robust understanding of:<br>
*The architecture and functioning of GPT-2 and similar transformer-based models.<br>
*Techniques to fine-tune and optimize chatbots for specific use cases.<br>
*Advanced methods like WaveNet for improving speech synthesis and conversational flow.
