# GPT-Mastery-SOC
The project aims to develop a personal chatbot using natural language processing techniques, specifically focusing on building a simplified version of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from scratch. 
Through a series of structured steps, participants will learn the fundamentals of neural networks, backpropagation, language modeling, and advanced techniques like WaveNet for generating human-like responses in a conversational setting.
